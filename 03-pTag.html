            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it's a code that's used to structure and define the content of a web page. HTML tells a web browser how to display text, images, and other multimedia on a webpage. It also allows users to click links and be redirected to new pages.

            HTML is a text-based markup language, where markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (< and >). Everything else is considered content.HTML is often used with other technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
